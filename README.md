# Phone catalog
This is a directory application project built using React. It allows users to find phones including their wishes and expectations. The site has added the ability to sort by price, year of production, or sort by alphabetical order. You can also use the search function on the site by specific phone names. The project utilizes carious technologies such as `classnames`, `react`, `reat-dom`, `react-router-dom`, `redux`, `redux-toolkit`, SCSS, and an API.
